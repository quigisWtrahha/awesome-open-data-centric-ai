## MapBasic
 
MapBasic is a programming language that allows you to create custom applications for MapInfo 11. You can use MapBasic to extend the geographic functionality, automate repetitive operations or integrate MapInfo 11 with other applications. MapBasic is based on BASIC and has a simple and easy-to-learn syntax. You can write MapBasic code in a text editor or use the MapBasic Development Environment (MBDE) that comes with MapInfo 11.
 
## VerticalMapper
 
VerticalMapper is a tool that helps you to display, manage and interpret grid-based continuous spatial information. You can use VerticalMapper to create grids or surfaces from point data by estimating values between known points. VerticalMapper also allows you to perform various grid operations such as interpolation, smoothing, filtering, contouring, shading and more. VerticalMapper works within MapInfo 11 and adds a new menu and toolbar for grid manipulation.
 
## Saturntools
 
Saturntools is a suite of transport planning software that can be used with MapInfo 11. Saturntools includes modules for traffic assignment, network editing, demand modeling, signal optimization and more. Saturntools can help you to plan and design efficient and sustainable transport systems using spatial data. Saturntools works as a separate application but can exchange data with MapInfo 11 via ODBC or shapefiles.
